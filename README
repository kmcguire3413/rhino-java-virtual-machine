Rhino

This is a project that I started to help me learn more about the 
internal workings of a Java virtual machine, and also to produce
a usable virtual machine for a embedded platform.


== COMPILATION ==
To compile the virtual machine you need to execute 'make' in the working
directory of the souce which should be the base directory. This will
create a executable 'rhino' which can be executed.

== READCLASS Sub-Directory ==
This contains a java program using my custom standard library of 
functions to load a class like it's self and parse it. This is just
a simple demonstration of doing something.
